Gen X old timers building with AI?

That’s exactly what I mean with Web 4.0.

It means it actually managed to get accepted, and has been managing to get adopted.

Web 4.0 is the AI-web, which steps up from Web 2.5 by adding AI-generated content.

#### *Flashback*

The Web 2.0 stepped up from the initial static web as the “content-web” where users were not only accessing but also producing content - the so called “facebook era”.

With Web 2.5, the “ubiquitous web” they could generate content anytime everywhere, which also rolled into the “app web” or the so called “instagram era”.

Web 3.0 was “the decentralised web”, an initial ideia that failed to even get accepted, and was not even close to being adopted, plus it unfortunately became somewhat poisoned by bad players.

#### *But now*

We jump ahead to Web 4.0 as a clear statement that it’s a different direction, the “AI web” where users use AI to generate content.

Just like with previous versions, true “adoption” milestone is achieved by creating new businesses, products and markets around Web 4.0.\
That requires a balance of three main factors that many are ignoring:
- the Added Value;
- the User Experience;
- the Cost-Effectiveness.

It’s normal that in an initial phase, more senior people are required to steer the boat under uncertain circumstances.\
As we mature we’ll be re-boosting our teams with all the junior folks like we always did.\
AI isn’t taking your job, it’s changing it like any tech always did.
