When working with animation - be it **virtual or robotic**, *character*- or *object*-wise, we commonly run into the need for **interpolation** techniques.
Choosing your techniques depends on the definition of your problem, as in:
* Does it run in *realtime* or *offline*?
* Do you need to blend between *animations*, or *poses* or *both*?
* Is it a *one-time* runner, or do you *continuously* want to keep driving the motion towards a *target*?

All these questions apply especially when you are working with **procedural animation**, i.e., one that is generated *on-the-fly* based on given parameters, which may be changing over time.

In that case you typically need it to run in *realtime*, and the motion can either be *continuously* generated from a **mathematical formulation** (e.g. *sine-waves*), **algorithmic formulation** (e.g. *inverse kinematics*) or to be the result of mixing pre-designed **static poses** and **animations** that should elegantly **blend** and **transition** together.

The **Nutty Motion Filter**[^1] (NMF) was created to work as a **motion interpolation** method that is especially directed at such **procedural animation** applications.
It can be applied anywhere in a motion generation pipeline (*typically at the end*) to a **discrete** and **non-continuous** *motion signal driver*, and outputs a C<sup>0</sup>, C<sup>1</sup> or C<sup>2</sup> **continuous motion signal** as a result, depending on the ***order*** of the filter that is used.
