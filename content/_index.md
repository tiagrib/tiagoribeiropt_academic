            **AGI company that provides Autonomous Digital People for a variety of markets**

              Focused on delivering product value through R&D that intersects the fields of computer graphics animation and artificial intelligence, including, but not limited to the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI within the context of interactive, autonomous behaviour and motion for full body virtual human characters. 
              In my vision, the success of this R&D lies in working together with an animation director.

              Within the challenge of creating new methods for real-time autonomous character animation that is based on the artist-CGI-AI triad, my responsabilities included:

              * Lead the technical and architectural development of the autonomous animation system.
              * Develop autonomous gesturing and social and emotional behaviours of digital people.
              * Participate in the product strategy with feedback from/to technology development.
              * Work with artists to ensure the animated motion looks natural and is fail-safe.
              * Invent mechanisms that enable autonomous animation of digital characters.
              * Create pipelines and workflows that allow to train, evaluate and integrate ML models (e.g. LLMs, GenAI) for animation
              * Promote, support and lead the transfer of research into product.
              * Establish directives for autonomous behaviour design and selection.
              * Provide guidelines for expressive behaviour of emotion and personality.
              * Define instruments to measure animate and interactive qualities of autonomous digital characters.
