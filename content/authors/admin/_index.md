As a **consultor**, **advisor** and **leader** in **AI technology**, be it **CGI** or **Robotics**, I focus not only on adopting and inventing **state-of-the-art** and world-class solutions, technologies and methodologies, but also on aligning new and existing technology with the given technical **requirements**, product and business **goals and strategy**, so that AI can be used to power products and a **Cost-Effective**, **Revenue-Focused** and **User-Experience**-driven manner.

How?
I am an eclectic **scientist** and **engineer** focused on **intelligent, interactive technology**, with a strong **academic** background, and additionally self-taught through my passion of animation, photography, cinema, music, sound design and nearly all other artful expressions. Through the years I have been building a unique career, focused on creating **intelligent artificial creatures** that exhibit the **illusion of life**.

My major work has been on **robots** and **digital people** that **interact** with **people**, in various contexts such as entertainment, education, personal- or labour- assistance, etc.
Within those fields, I have accumulated **over 13 years of expertise** in **animation systems** and **interactive technology** for **autonomous social agents**.

My creatures aren’t lifelike solely by **design** or by **movement**.
That's why I always start any presentations by saying:

_Animation isn't just about motion - it is about expressing thought, identity, emotion and intention._

I strive to understand and create the basic underlying mechanisms that allow an artificial intelligence to portray its **existence** through an **artificial embodiment**, be it virtual or robotic, abstract or human-like.
In essence, I’ve been architecting and engineering **Autonomous Characters**.

During my PhD I brought together the fields of **computer animation and robotics** to create **social, interactive robots**, that look and feel as **animate** and **alive** as the **characters** I love from movies.
That meant linking **artificial intelligence** and interactive **robotics control**, with **character animation**, and **human-robot interaction**.
I called it **Robot Animation**, which became the cornerstone of my career.

In the past five years I've focused on **virtual characters** by performing and leading **R&D** on **autonomous, lifelike animation** of **Digital People** (DPs), at **Soul Machines**, including developing their **automomous gesturing** capabilities, their ability to connect **socially** and **emotionally** with users, and making them more capable and better integrated with new technologies such as **LLMs**, and new markets such as **digital celebrities and influencers**, **_metaverse_** and alikes.
Such DPs can be authored and personalized for various tasks, goals, environments, audiences and services.
They present a **real-time**, **lifelike performance** through a properly crafted balance between **biologically-inspired** behaviour systems, with both **artistically-directed** and **generative motion and behaviour**, all integrated into a complex **AI ecosystem** of **linguistic and conversation** models and **multimodal interactive technologies**.

My connection with the arts is very **personal**, and is driven in most part by my **passion for animation**, but also for **digital film** and **photography**, three particular fields on which I am mostly self-taught and also explore as a hobby. These **creative abilities** and understanding, allied with my **technical background**, have allowed me to work in teams with both **artists**, **roboticists**, **social-scientists** and **software-engineers**, to bring them **together** and build a bridge between all those worlds.

By **working together** and in **multi-disciplinary** settings, we are better able to **materialize our imagination** into **real**, physical **achievements**, and to push all those fields **forward into the future**.
