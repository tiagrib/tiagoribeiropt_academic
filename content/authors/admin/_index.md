I am an eclectic **scientist** and **engineer** who’s major pursuit is the connection between **arts** and **intelligent, interactive technology**.

My major work has been on **robots** that **interact** with **people**, in various contexts such as entertainment, education, personal- or labour- assistance, etc.
Within those fields, I have accumulated **9 years of expertise in animation** and **behaviour management** technology for **autonomous social robots**.

Technically my expertise includes programming lower-level software that controls robots, to high-level **animation tools** and **plug-ins** that are suitable for non-technical personnel and end-users, such as artists and psychologists, and also all the **middleware** that is required to integrate such tools and robots with **socially-aware artificial intelligence** that drives the **interaction**.

More recently I moved back into the **Intelligent Virtual Characters** field by joining an award-winning team at **Soul Machines**, where I’m developing **animation systems** and technology that allow our **digital heros** to convey the same **Illusion of Life** while **interacting with humans** in smart environments.

In summary, **my job is to create technology** that allows creating such **artificial intelligence creatures**.

My connection with the arts is very **personal**, and is driven in most part by my **passion for animation**, but also for **digital film** and **photography**, three particular fields on which I am mostly self-taught and also explore as a hobby. These **creative abilities** and understanding, allied with my **technical background**, have allowed me to stand together with both **artists**, **roboticists**, **social-scientists** and **software-engineers**, to bring them **together** and build a bridge between all those worlds.

By **working together** and in **multi-disciplinary** settings, we are better able to **materialize our imagination** into **real**, physical **achievements**, and to push all those fields **forward into the future**.
